# Error Handling and Recovery Rules

## Error Boundaries
- React Error Boundaries MUST be implemented at route and component levels
- Error boundaries MUST provide fallback UI with recovery options
- Critical errors MUST be logged to external monitoring services
- Error boundaries SHOULD allow users to retry failed operations

## Network Error Handling
- All API calls MUST implement proper error handling
- Network timeouts MUST be configured with reasonable defaults
- Retry logic MUST be implemented for transient failures
- Offline states SHOULD be handled gracefully with user feedback

## Form and Input Validation
- Client-side validation MUST provide immediate feedback
- Server-side validation MUST be the source of truth
- Validation errors MUST be displayed clearly near relevant fields
- Form submission errors MUST prevent data loss

## Database Error Handling
- Database connection failures MUST be handled gracefully
- Transaction rollbacks MUST be implemented for failed operations
- Constraint violations MUST provide user-friendly error messages
- Data integrity errors MUST be logged and monitored

## POS-Specific Error Scenarios
- Payment failures MUST preserve order state for retry
- Inventory conflicts MUST be resolved with clear user guidance
- Real-time connection losses MUST trigger reconnection attempts
- Print failures SHOULD allow manual receipt generation

## User Experience
- Error messages MUST be written in plain language
- Technical error details MUST NOT be exposed to end users
- Recovery actions SHOULD be suggested when possible
- Critical errors MUST provide contact information for support

## Logging and Monitoring
- All errors MUST be logged with sufficient context
- Error rates MUST be monitored and alerted on
- User-facing errors SHOULD include correlation IDs
- Performance impacts of error handling MUST be minimized
